In this project i have made a Django project for double entry system.
these are the simple steps are as follows.
1. Define Database Tables:
For a double-entry system project, typical tables might include:
•	Customers
•	Accounts
•	Transactions
•	Journal Entries
These SQL statements define the structure of the tables and their relationships.

2. Establish Relationships:
In the provided SQL statements, we've established relationships between the tables using foreign keys. For example:

The transactions table has a foreign key customer_id referencing the id column in the customers table.
The journal_entries table has foreign keys debit_account_id and credit_account_id referencing the id column in the accounts table.
3. Database Diagrams:
We can create ER (Entity-Relationship) diagrams to visualize the structure of the database. These diagrams show the tables and their relationships.

4. Django REST API Project:
We'll create a Django project and app for the REST API. We'll define serializers and views for each table to handle CRUD operations.

5. Integration:
We'll integrate the Django project with the database tables by defining Django models that correspond to the database tables.

6. API Endpoints:
We'll define API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data for each table.
